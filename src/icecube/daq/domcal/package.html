<p>This package allows programmatic access from Java
to the DOM calibration information.  The class reads
<code>.xdc</code> files which contain DOM calibration
data in an XML document and place the information
into a Java class.  All the programmer needs to do is
construct an instance of the <code>Calibrator</code>
class with either a URL or an InputStream pointing to
the XML object.</p>
<p>The primary utility of this class is to transform
the raw ATWD waveform data into volt units.  This
can be accomplished one of two ways - either:
<ul>
    <li>Through explicit calls to the
    <code>getATWDFitParam(int ch, int bin, String param)</code>
    member function.  This provides the programmer with
    the actual fit information.  Note that the fit
    parameters may vary depending on what the fit model
    is; currently only the 'linear' fit model is used.</li>
    <li>Through the high-level member function
    <code>calibrateATWD</code> which takes a raw ATWD
    buffer array and returns a calibrated buffer array.
    Please note that the DC bias is not subtracted off
    in this function.  The inverse function
    <code>decalibrateATWD</code> performs the inverse
    calibration, taking volts back into counts.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The other calibrations tracked by this class are the
front-end pulser calibration, the amplifier gains, and the
ATWD sampling frequency.</p>
